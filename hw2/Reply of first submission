Hi,  
This the intial grade for you homework 2.

1) Basic Correctness: 5/6

Exercise 7: In fact, this question is not focused on the expectation. We want only a (general) formula describing the relation between C(\pi,k) and B (or A). But I think even the expectation is correctly derived. Therefore, as your corollaries of exercise 7, answers to exercise 8-9 are not correct.

2) Academic Writing: 1.5
You do not have to show me codes when describing an algorithm.
Although I cannot be sure that your pdf is not generated by latex but I strongly recommend you to type in formulas with latex especially when I see symbols like '*' and 'log's in the italic form. In college mathematics, we should avoid describing ``because'' and ``thereby'' with three dots. They are symbols from classical Eucdlidean geometry created two thousand years ago (not part of modern math).

3) Rigorousness and Succinctness: 2

overall: 8.5

Best,
Shuyang
