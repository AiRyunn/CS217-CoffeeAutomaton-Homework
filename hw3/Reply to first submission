Hi,
Here is the first feedback of your 3rd homework of CS217.

Coffee auto：（10）

Basic correctness: 6/6

Academic Writing: 2

You can try a bigger font and a larger page margin.

Rigorousness & Succinctness: 2

You are encouraged to try exercise 4 with more advanced tools taught in the class, but your current answer is fine.


Best,
Shuyang
